The Canadian Journal of Statistics
Special issue on “COVID-19: Statisticians in Action” – Call for Submissions
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, The Canadian Journal of Statistics (CJS) plans to devote a special issue to “COVID-19:
Statisticians in Action”. We aim to showcase statistical research on the design and analysis of COVID-19 studies, discuss challenges
posed by COVID-19 data, identify emerging issues, and demonstrate the importance of a strong statistical presence in collaborations
with public health researchers and other scientists studying the pandemic.
We invite the submission of research articles, reviews, or focussed discussions. We welcome papers on a broad range of topics,
including the design and analysis of specific types of studies, the analysis of disease surveillance data, statistical issues related to demographic, epidemiological and genetic studies of the disease, and to the evolution of the pandemic and its impact on public health and
the economy.
The submission deadline is December 31, 2020. A speedy review will be given to all submissions according to the usual CJS
criteria. Please submit your paper through the CJS submission website, specifying that the submission is for the special issue on
“COVID-19: Statisticians in Action”: http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/cjs-wiley
